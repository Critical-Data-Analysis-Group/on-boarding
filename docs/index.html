<h1>About the Lab Book</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Critical Data Analysis Group Collaboration Protocols! Here we outline the values that guide our work, group roles and responsibilities, protocols for facilitating meetings, guidelines for documenting our work, and expectations on group conduct.</p>
<p>These protocols are inspired from the work of several groups that inspire us - in particular the <a href="https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/lab_book">Carceral Ecologies Lab Book</a>, the <a href="https://civiclaboratory.nl/clear-lab-book/">CLEAR Lab Book</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/blob/master/aly-lab-manual.pdf">Aly Lab Manual</a>, the PECE Design Team Protocols, and the Energy Rights Project Protocols. In-text citations are provided throughout the document where text is drawn directly from these sources documents. Full citations of these resources are listed in the References section.</p>
<p>Further, the protocols are continuously being collectively (re)authored as new members join the group.</p>

<h1>Our Value Framework</h1>
<div id="as-collaborators-we-will" class="section level2">
<h2>As collaborators, we will:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Respect</em> each other’s boundaries, inside and outside of the lab. Understand and be receptive to when others set boundaries.</li>
<li><em>Be open</em> to questions. Respect people’s prior knowledge, and be open to new ideas.</li>
<li><em>Support</em> one another by celebrating each other’s successes and acknowledging their work.</li>
<li><em>Support</em> one another, especially when there are hiccups. Offer to help, a fresh set of eyes will always be useful.</li>
<li><em>Communicate</em> with care and transparency. We know that everyone has other commitments that might interfere with their work.</li>
<li><em>Provide</em> clear instruction on project timeline, expectations, progress, and issues.</li>
<li><em>Update</em> the team of progress and if issues arise.</li>
<li><em>Be proactive!</em> Problems will be common, take initiative to rectify the situation.</li>
<li><em>Distribute</em> even amounts of responsibility and do not wait for the last minute to accomplish the work needed.</li>
<li><em>Listen!</em> Communication is key in collaborations, so be willing to compromise and listen to each other’s opinions and ideas, as well as when others are uncomfortable.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="it-is-important-to" class="section level2">
<h2>It is important to:</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><em>Provide</em> constructive and sensitive criticism, as well as be willing to have assumptions be challenged. We can always learn from others.</li>
<li><em>Be open</em> to discussion. We are on the same team, but disagreement is always alright. However, when disagreeing we criticize the ideas, not the topics.</li>
<li><em>Honor</em> each other’s identities and backgrounds. We all come from different levels of knowledge.</li>
<li><em>Be optimistic!</em> Being supportive throughout the project provides a thriving environment.</li>
<li><em>Ensure equity</em> in different outcomes. Do not exploit community groups we collaborate with.</li>
<li><em>Recognize</em> the unintended impact our work may have on people and communities, as well as understanding our knowledge’s limit on the social situations of others.<br />
</li>
<li><em>Promote</em> gratitude by ensuring citational equity.</li>
<li><em>Understand</em> that the topics we discuss are serious and real problems. Approach the topics, questions, and other perspectives with curiosity rather than judgment.</li>
<li><em>Transparency</em> on limitations of our research. Having a nuanced discussion on what we see, but what we cannot or do not know.</li>

<h2>Faculty Responsibilities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section draws heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/lab_book">Carceral Ecologies Lab Book</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/blob/master/aly-lab-manual.pdf">Aly Lab Manual</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>As the director of the Critical Data Analysis Group, I commit to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Support you (academically, intellectually, emotionally, financially)</li>
<li>Provide timely feedback on project ideas, data analysis, writing, and presentations</li>
<li>Review and approve timesheets on a timely basis</li>
<li>Be regularly available in person and via email to discuss both lab-related research and other research interests</li>
<li>Support your career development (e.g. helping you network with people in the field, introducing you to infrastructures and workflows that may be relevant to your future career, writing recommendation letters, and inviting you to attend conferences when finances permit)</li>
<li>Ensuring that you are acknowledged for your contributions in all presentations of our work</li>
<li>Encourage you to prioritize your physical and emotional well-being before other obligations</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="student-researcher-responsibilities" class="section level2">
<h2>Student Researcher Responsibilities</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>This section draws heavily from the <a href="https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/lab_book">Carceral Ecologies Lab Book</a> and the <a href="https://civiclaboratory.nl/clear-lab-book/">CLEAR Lab Book</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As a student researcher, you will be expected to:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Take care of your physical and mental well-being first.</em> If you are sick or burnt out, please stay home. If possible, let us know ahead of time that you need to step back. The <a href="https://www.smith.edu/student-life/health-wellness">Schacht Center</a> has a number of resources available to help navigate distressing times.</li>
<li><em>Attend weekly lab meetings.</em> Lab meetings are held weekly for one-hour. In these meetings, we discuss how we operate as a lab and as a community, along with our progress on a number of projects. Please let us know ahead of time if you cannot make a meeting via the #general channel on Slack - preferably at least 24 hours in advance (though we recognize this is not always possible). You do not need to explain why you cannot attend a meeting in this message, but please don’t create a habit of missing meetings.</li>
<li><em>Take personal initiative with group support.</em> While we collaborate as a team, each individual member of our group has a personal responsibility to ensure that their contributions to the work get done. There will not be a great deal of oversight of your work, so we expect that each member will take steps to manage their time effectively, honestly communicate their capacity to contribute, and let us know if/when they need to re-evaluate their time commitments. To help cultivate and sustain this culture of accountability, all group members are encouraged to support each other by outlining <strong>manageable</strong> tasks, helping out with tasks in times of struggle (when asked), and respecting a group member’s decision to step back when needed.</li>
<li><em>Problem solve when you can. Ask questions when you are unsure.</em> We are all here to help each other navigate this work, and we encourage you to ask questions and request help when it’s needed. Still, attempting to problem solve when you can demonstrates that you value your collaborator’s time, so try that first. If you learn how to do something that might be helpful to others, share it in our Slack Workspace!</li>
<li><em>Contribute to a caring and collaborative environment.</em> Celebrate each other’s successes, respect each other’s individual strengths and weaknesses, demonstrate compassion for each other’s struggles, and affirm each other’s diverse identities.</li>
<li><em>Mistakes happen. Admit mistakes, and then move on.</em></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="assignment-of-roles" class="section level2">
<h2>Assignment of Roles</h2>
<p>Roles get assigned to members of the lab that have already been with us for a full semester. After your first semester as a lab member, you will be expected to take on at least one role per semester. Roles will be assigned during the previous semester’s last lab meeting and will be rotated every semester. Roles will be determined on a volunteer basis and confirmed via group consensus.</p>
<p>Note-taking will be a shared rotating responsibility. We will maintain a spreadsheet listing who is responsible for note-taking in the Google Drive.</p>

<h1>Communication</h1>
<div id="slack" class="section level2">
<h2>Slack</h2>
<p>Slack will be the primary means of lab communication. <a href="criticaldataanalysis.slack.com">Here</a> is a link to our Slack Workspace. This Slack channel is on the Smith Enterprise Workspace, meaning that anyone with a Smith email address can immediately be added to this Workspace and view and join all public channels, but guests must be invited and manually added to relevant channels. When posting message, please be sure to post in the relevant channel:</p>
<ul>
<li>#general: announcements to all group members</li>
<li>#[project-name]: communication regarding a particular CDAG project</li>
<li>#support: questions about the group protocols, timesheet reporting, or other group infrastructures</li>
<li>#cheers: celebrate lab member accomplishments or express gratitude for a lab member’s work</li>
<li>#random: non-work related conversations</li>
</ul>
<p>Since Slack is our primary means of communication, you should check Slack regularly. You may wish to install the Slack Desktop application to help keep track of Slack messages. You can also <a href="https://slack.com/help/articles/201355156-Configure-your-Slack-notifications#">configure Slack</a> to notify you when messages come through on specific channels. You are not expected to respond to Slack messages on evenings and weekends.</p>
</div>
<div id="github" class="section level2">
<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>When you join the lab, you will be added to our <a href="https://github.com/Critical-Data-Analysis-Group">GitHub organization</a>. We will keep most lab protocols, documents, and code in repositories under this organization. There are series of repository templates available for creating new GitHub repositories. We’ve created these templates to ensure consistency across our folder structures and completeness in the contents of our README documents. Please be sure to select the appropriate template before creating a new repo. Reach out to Lindsay if you are unsure of which template is most appropriate.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div id="lab-meeting-protocols" class="section level1">
<h1>Lab Meeting Protocols</h1>
<p>The general format for all lab meetings is as follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>Opening: Lab manager disseminates link to meeting notes document and takes attendance. Note-taker is determined by referencing the rotating note-taker schedule in the Drive.</li>
<li>Group check-in: Lab manager asks the group check-in question: <em>Where is your head and your heart today?</em> Everyone has an opportunity to respond (round robin style). Members may pass if they choose.</li>
<li>New member: New members introduce themselves to the group, offering their name and pronouns, their academic and research interests, and what inspires them to engage in justice and integrity-focused data work.</li>
<li>Project updates: For each project, group members detail what was accomplished since the last meeting, what they plan to accomplish in the coming week, and what is getting in the way of being able to accomplish those tasks. Everyone has an opportunity to ask questions.</li>
<li>Lab check-in: Group members have an opportunity to ask questions or voice concerns about any aspects of lab operations.</li>
<li>Summary: We close each meeting with the note-taker summarizing to-do list items for the next week.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="documentation" class="section level1">
<h1>Documentation</h1>
<div id="lab-meeting-agendas-and-meeting-notes" class="section level2">
<h2>Lab Meeting Agendas and Meeting Notes</h2>
<p>All lab meeting agendas and notes will be stored in one running Google Drive document. In this document, each new meeting should be marked with the date of the meeting formatted as ‘Heading 1’. This will ensure each date appears in the document’s table of contents so that we can quickly navigate to those notes. Notes should list who was in attendance at a meeting, along with pertinent information discussed during the meeting.</p>
</div>
<div id="google-drive" class="section level2">
<h2>Google Drive</h2>
<p>We maintain a shared Google Drive for all shared lab documents and files that are not hosted in GitHub repositories. This may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>lab meeting agendas and meeting notes</li>
<li>datasets that are too large for GitHub storage</li>
<li>drafts of collaboratively edited manuscripts, abstracts, or proposals</li>
<li>data inventories and quality assurance checklists</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Be sure to reference the Drive Organization file for guidance on where to store files in the Google Drive.</p>
</div>
<div id="code-and-data-documentation" class="section level2">
<h2>Code and Data Documentation</h2>
<p>For code and data documentation, we will follow the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f3isQQS7uho_vto2Bf5HvbZBtUA0Pe0f7NlR_ARjTQ8/edit?usp=sharing">Hack for California Guidelines</a> (soon to be updated and adapted for our specific work.)</p>

<div id="authorship-acknowledgements" class="section level1">
<h1>Authorship &amp; Acknowledgements</h1>
<p>As members of the group, you may be asked to participate in the preparation of manuscripts, presentations, or other forms of media presenting our work. As the faculty lab director, it is Lindsay’s responsibility to ensure that:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Group members are properly acknowledged for their contributions to the group in all presentations of our work.</li>
<li>Opportunities for authorship and presenting our work are equitably distributed across group members. Note that, while we will always work to value and reward diverse forms of labor in this group, promoting equity in authorship sometimes means prioritizing credit to those that, for a number of reasons, haven’t been able to contribute quite as much as others.

<li>Clear and direct conversations about authorship and acknowledgements are held early in the process and are revisited as necessary as the work progresses.</li>

<h1>Code of Conduct</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>This anti-harassment policy is based on the example policy from the <a href="http://geekfeminism.wikia.com/wiki/Community_anti-harassment:">Geek Feminism wiki</a>, created by the Geek Feminism community.</p>

<p>The Critical Data Analysis Group is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.</p>
<p>This code of conduct applies to all Critical Data Analysis Group spaces, including lab meetings, our Slack Workspace, and our GitHub, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the project director.</p>
<p>Some Critical Data Analysis Group spaces may have additional rules in place, which will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible for knowing and abiding by these rules.</p>
